<h1>How the Law4Sure scales of justice work</h1>

<p>The Law4Sure scales of justice will turn from black to green when you are visiting a website that has been verified by us, against data provided by the SRA and CLC.
    It won't turn green for non law related or websites that we were unable to verify. Please be vigilant.
